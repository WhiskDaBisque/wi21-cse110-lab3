* What did I do yesterday?
    I mainly reviewed git commands and tried to incorporate CSS with my HTML.
* What will I do today?
    I will continue to implement varius CSS to my HTML, even changing some of the HTML
* Where am I blocked?
    The design of the site isn't to my satisfaction, this keeps me stuck on a single task w/o getting
    much done.
* Comfort level - How close am I to hitting my goal?
    On a scale of 1-10 with 1 being not probable to 10 being This is perfect, I am currently a 5.
